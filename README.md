### **Directory structure 2017-09-22**  
This is the first version of the structure. The idea is to seperate the project into three main parts: data, ML and GUI. You will find a few _.gitkeep_-files in a few directories. GitLab does not allow you to create empty-directories so as soon as there are more files they can be removed.    
- **/data**                
  - /content         
  - /news       
  - /user_data       
- **/machine learning**   
  - /prediction   
  - /matching        
  - /libraries    
- **/GUI**              
  - /admin        
  - /user  
  - /img
  - /login
- **/flask**
  - /app
  - /dp-repository

###### **How to log in as admin (sprint 1, 2017-10-04)**
If you try to log in as an admin from the login
page directly after starting the application, you will get an error. 
To get around this:
1. click on the "user" href link on the login page
2. click "log out" in the upper right corner
3. enter "admin" as user and "admin" as password and click the "login" button
