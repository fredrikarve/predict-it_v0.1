### **Directory structure 2017-09-22**  
This is the first version of the structure. The idea is to seperate the project into three main parts: data, ML and GUI. You will find a few _.gitkeep_-files in a few directories. GitLab does not allow you to create empty-directories so as soon as there are more files they can be removed.    
- **/data**                
  - /content         
  - /news       
  - /user_data       
- **/machine learning**   
  - /prediction   
  - /matching        
  - /libraries    
- **/GUI**              
  - /admin        
  - /user  
  - /img
  - /login
- **/flask**
  - /app
  - /dp-repository
